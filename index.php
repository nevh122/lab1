<font size=5 style="text-align:center">Hello everyone I am Nicolas Eduardo Huet, but most people call me Ned as per my first names abbreviation.

I am a Introvert, meaning I will try to always be there to be a friend, classmate or someone to talk and not just a plain shut in. It just means that we introverts prefer to spend their free time much alone but doesn't mean we hate company. Video games are my go to games with focus on linear gameplay with hard stories. Same goes for books such as The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Fleming.

Hot beverages help me start the morning right followed by anything that can be easily eaten by hand with some music to help me start my senses up.</font></center>
